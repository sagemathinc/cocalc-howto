# JAX Quickstart on CoCalc using a GPU (or on CPU)

VIDEO: https://youtu.be/Uwn3ngzXD0Y

"JAX is a Python library for accelerator-oriented array computation and program transformation, designed for high-performance numerical computing and large-scale machine learning.   Basically, JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research."

This video shows how to use JAX (https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  on CoCalc with or without a GPU.
